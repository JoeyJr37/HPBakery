<h2 style="text-align: center" class="title"> The story so far </h2><br>
<p>From a young girl baking sweets with her mom, Hannah has always enjoyed creating desserts for herself and others. At the same time, baking is more than simply a time of fellowship and creation in the kitchen, but also a way for Hannah to contribute to something bigger than herself. In the 10th grade after hearing about orphans in Africa with AIDs she determined to help by selling her baked goods and donating all the proceeds to an organization combating the issue. Hannah's heart for justice blossomed throughout her life, including spending time in India working with a survivor of human trafficking on the road to restoration. The pair would bake together as Hannah taught her English and would then share the desserts with others. </p>
<br>
<p>Throughout the years Hannah's involvement in social justice issues has developed and changed, but her heart to engage with the issues and bring restoration, wholeness and freedom has stayed the same. One of Hannah's dreams is to live out Isaiah 61 and bring freedom to captives, gladness to those who mourn and a double portion to those who were shamed by teaching, training and employing young women who are survivors of human trafficking. As a way of being involved even now, a portion of the profits Just Desserts receives goes to supporting organizations who are actively engaged in anti-human trafficking activities. Thank you for supporting Hannah in this fight because as she likes to say "we are better together!"</p>
