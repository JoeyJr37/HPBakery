<h2 style="text-align: center" class="title"> The story so far </h2><br>
<section class="about-text">
<p>From a young girl baking sweets with her mom, Hannah has always enjoyed creating desserts for herself and others. 
  At the same time, baking is more than simply a time of fellowship and creation in the kitchen, 
  but also a way for Hannah to contribute to something bigger than herself. 
  In the 10th grade after hearing about orphans in Africa with AIDs she determined to help by 
  selling her baked goods and donating all the proceeds to an organization combating the issue. 
  Hannah's heart for justice blossomed throughout her life, including spending time in India working 
  with a survivor of human trafficking on the road to restoration. The pair would bake together 
  as Hannah taught her English and would then share the desserts with others. </p>
<br>
  <p>More than just bringing sweetness into your life, these desserts are created to expose the darkness of human
    trafficking and slavery so that those who are oppressing others will get their just desserts and the survivors will
    have an opportunity to live in freedom. There are still over 20 million people being trafficked or in slavery. 
    Each dessert purchased donates to one of our charity partners who work to raise awareness of this issue 
    through the Houston area, as well as providing healing to the survivors of such a crime. 
    This is about more than just desserts!
